Day #23 - Domain Name Server (DNS):

A short break due to illness, we are back on track.

www.google.com(url), after you type this in the browser, it takes the following journey:-

url -> DNS resolver

DNS resolver is some system with caching mechanism, if you have visited the url before, it must have been resolved and cached.

DNS resolver -> root DNS servers

If the url is not found in cache, we move to root DNS servers, it checks the root(.com, .org etc.) and funnels the request to respective TLD's

root DNS -> Top Level Domain(TLD) servers

The funneled url now enters the TLD, where there is a connection to authorative name servers, This is just for more accurate funneling.

TLD -> Authorative Name Servers:-

The authorative name servers holds the DNS records in the form of domain key and IP value, eg IPv4, IPv6 etc.

After fetching the ip address, this is sent to the browser to establish a connection, Why are we using google.com instead of its ip? because we cant remember its IP, it is not humanly possible. Therefore we make a search with the name only.

www -> subdomain(part of a website, it can be anyother subdomain also)
google -> domain(The main name to which the ip is mapped in the DNS records)
. -> root(helps to bifurcate between domain and TLD)
com -> Top level domain(specifies the location, com-> commercial, in -> india), helps in redirecting the request to CDN's.
(mostly, .com combined is referred to as TLD).
